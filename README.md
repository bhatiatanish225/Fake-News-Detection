# Fake News Detection Project

## **Introduction**

In today's world, fake news spreads very fast through online platforms, social media, and websites. Fake news can mislead people and create confusion. This project aims to develop a **machine learning model** that can detect whether a news article is **real or fake**.

We have used **four different machine learning models** to classify news articles:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Gradient Boost Classifier**
- **Random Forest Classifier**

By comparing these models, we can find out which one gives the best accuracy in detecting fake news.

## **Project Overview**

Fake news is a big problem because it spreads false information and influences peopleâ€™s opinions. This project uses machine learning algorithms to **analyze news articles and predict whether they are real or fake**. By using this model, we can help reduce the spread of misinformation.

### **How It Works**
1. We collect a dataset of news articles that are labeled as **True (Real News)** or **False (Fake News)**.
2. We clean and process the data so that our model can understand it better.
3. We train four different machine learning models and compare their results.
4. We evaluate each modelâ€™s performance using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score**.
5. Finally, we use the best model to predict whether new articles are fake or real.

## **Dataset**

We used a labeled dataset that contains news articles along with their classification:
- **True (Real News):** News articles from reliable sources.
- **False (Fake News):** Fabricated or misleading news articles.

The dataset is divided into two parts:
- **Training Data:** Used to train the model.
- **Testing Data:** Used to check how well the model performs.

## **System Requirements**

### **Hardware Requirements**
- **Minimum 4GB RAM** (For smooth execution of the model)
- **Intel i3 Processor or higher**
- **500MB free disk space**

### **Software Requirements**
- **Python (Version 3.x)**
- **Anaconda (Optional, for Jupyter Notebook support)**
- **Code Editor (Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, or PyCharm)**

---
## **Dependencies**
Before running the project, you need to install the following Python libraries:

```sh
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install sklearn
pip install seaborn
pip install re
```

These libraries help in **data processing, visualization, and model training**.

## **How to Run the Project**

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
First, download the project files using Git:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/kapilsinghnegi/Fake-News-Detection.git
```

### **Step 2: Navigate to the Project Folder**
```sh
cd fake-news-detection
```

### **Step 3: Train and Test the Model**
Run the Python scripts for different classifiers. For example, to run the **Random Forest Classifier**, use:
```sh
python random_forest_classifier.py
```

The model will analyze news articles and predict if they are **real or fake**.

---
## **Results and Evaluation**

After training and testing the models, we evaluate their performance using:
- **Accuracy:** How often the model makes correct predictions.
- **Precision:** How many predicted fake news articles are actually fake.
- **Recall:** How many real fake news articles were correctly identified.
- **F1 Score:** A balance between precision and recall.

Each classifier gives different results. We compare them and choose the best one for fake news detection.

---
## **Conclusion**

This project successfully builds a **fake news detection system using machine learning**. By using different classifiers, we can find the best-performing model that accurately detects fake news. This system can be further improved with **more data and advanced deep learning models**.

Fake news is a growing problem, and this project is a step towards solving it with technology. ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€
